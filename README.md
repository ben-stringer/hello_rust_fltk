Hello Rust FLTK
---------------

Very simple reverse polish notation (RPN) calculator
written in Rust using FLTK.
The purpose of this exercise is to explore the GUI
features of FLTK while maintaining a data model separate
from the GUI logic, which is lacking in most GUI demos.

I did not implement the backspace button.

More importantly, I could not figure out how to left-align the output.
I've considered using an html panel, but it's not worth the effort now.
